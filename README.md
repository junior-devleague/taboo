# taboo

Communication is key in this game where saying certain words is 'taboo'. Students will have to get creative in explaining each concept or term!

## Objective

Break the ice, form team bonds within the classroom, and review terms learned previously. One student will have a word to explain with 3-4 'taboo' words listed underneath it. This student will have to explain the word to the group without using those 'taboo' words. Other students within the group will guess what that word is by shouting it out. The group with the most points wins, or the group that correctly guesses more words wins. Multiple groups can be made depending on the class size and a timer for each word may be used if needed.

## General  
Notes | Expectations
--------|------------
Class Size | 5+  
Instructors | 1+
Prep Time | 20-30 minutes
Activity Time | 15 - 20 minutes
Noise Level | Moderate - Loud
Beware | Students with harder cards may not be able to say anything at all! You could implement a system where they can call a friend if stuck ...etc. Shy students may not want to shout out the answer.

## Preparation

Instructor should prepare the following:
* List of ~10+ cards (index cards, printout..etc.) with 1 word to explain and 2-3 taboo words underneath it.

## Activity

### Rules
* No saying the 'taboo' words!
* Other students should not see the word (student explaining should be facing the group).

### Arrangement

1. Form groups if needed.
2. Have a student draw a card.

### On your Mark, Get Set, Go!   
1. This student tries to explain the word to the group without using the 'taboo' words.
2. If another student guesses the word correctly, another person draws a card (it can be the person that guessed correctly or a volunteer).

### Winner!
1. It can be point based (points awarded if the team guesses correctly), or based on the number of cards they are able to go through.

### Next Round
1. Next person draws a card and tries to explain it.
